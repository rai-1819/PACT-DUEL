# ⚔️ PACT DUEL – Gentleman’s Warfare of Calculated Honor

**“Every bond hides a blade; every pact ends in a duel.”**  
A strategic psychological duel inspired by Split-or-Steal — reimagined into a multi-layered battlefield of trust, deception, and mind games.

---

## 🧠 What is PACT DUEL?

A high-stakes, face-to-face strategy game where players negotiate, deceive, read intentions, and fight for honor (and prize). The game elevates the classic prisoner’s dilemma by adding:

✅ 3 hidden archetypes instead of 2  
✅ A consequence system that punishes misjudgment  
✅ A hierarchy of **Gambits** for advanced showdown duels  

PACT DUEL turns **trust into a weapon**… and **betrayal into philosophy**.

## 🎭 Character Archetypes

Every player is a mindset:

| Archetype | Core Intent | Strength | Vulnerability |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **Saint** | Split | Earns trust | Easy prey |
| **Impostor** | Steal | Deception | If exposed, loses everything |
| **Arbiter** | Judge | Punishes greed | Punished by innocence |

Each role hides its morality until the reveal — and transforms every round into a **mind hunt**.

## 🎮 Core Gameplay Flow

Talk → Secret Choice → Reveal → Consequences

Copy code

1️⃣ Negotiation (bluff, persuasion, reading emotions)  
2️⃣ Private Decision (Split, Steal, or Judge)  
3️⃣ Reveal (reputation shifts instantly)  
4️⃣ Tension escalates → next duel phase  

### Base Decision Grid

| You \ Opponent | Split | Steal | Judge |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Split** | 50-50 | 0-100 | 100-0 |
| **Steal** | 100-0 | 0-0 | 0-100 |
| **Judge** | 0-100 | 100-0 | *Triggers Gambits* |

If trust collapses → The duel escalates through advanced psychological challenges:

- **Karma Gambit**
- **Impostor Gambit**
- **Ragnarok Gambit**
- **Redemption Gambit**
- **Duality Gambit**
- **Master Gambit** (wildcard!)
